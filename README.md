# Tweet To Toot â€“ export your Twitter threads to Mastodon

## VERY MUCH UNFINISHED. THERE SHOULD BE A GREEK LETTER BEFORE ALPHA. IT'S A SORRY MESS. WHY IS THIS EVEN PUBLIC.

You want to break free of the site formerly known as Twitter but do not want to lose your numerous, ongoing, carefully maintained, years-long threads?

This tool is for your: [grab an archive](https://twitter.com/settings/download_your_data) of your Twitter account, republish the threads your want on Mastodon and start anew.

Under the hood is a stripped-down fork of [Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback) and [a client](https://github.com/neet/masto.js/) using the Mastodon API.

## Required

Node v18 or 19. NVM advised if it's not your typical Node environnment.

## Setup

- Clone or download this repository
- In your terminal, go to the folder of the project
- Run npm install
- Copy `./data/tweets.js` from your Twitter archive zip file into the `./database` directory of this project.
- Rename `window.YTD.tweet.part0` in `tweets.js` to `module.exports`
- Run `npm run create-db`
- Grab a Mastodon API token by following [these instructions](https://neet.github.io/masto.js/#md:quick-start).
- Add the token and the URL or you instance as environnment variables, for instance in a file named .env at the root of your project.

## Usage

Examples:

- `npm run publish -- --ids=1157670494390378498 --intro="imported thread, started in 2019 on the Other Site" --dry-run`

- `npm run publish -- --ids=1157670494390378498,1157670494390378498`


## Parameters

`--ids`: One or several IDs of twitter posts. These ID can be found at the end of their URL, after "status/". The tool will use these as a starting poing and find more recent replies in your archive. So choose the oldest post in your thread.

`--intro`: Short text in quotes. Optional. Append a post at the beginning of your Mastodon thread.

`--wait`: Number of seconds. Waiting period between each request to Mastodon. Default : half a second.

`--dry-run`: Show thread without publishing it.

### To do

`--mergeQuote`:  Default to false. Defines behavior for quoted tweets of yourself. If false, it will keep the quote as a link to Twitter.com. If true, it will merge the content of the quote with the post.

`--concatWith`: Mastodon post id. Optional. If provided, the thread will be posted as a continuation of this post. Useful if you want merge threads.


## Caveats

- Twitter can show threads with deleted messages in the middle. This tool can't. Workaround: Use it twice and the second time specifiy a `concatWith` option.
- Use `wait` generously. Because Mastodon default rate limits can be quickly reached with media. And of course because of general respect to instance maintainers.
